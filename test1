Indians continue to show their entrepreneurial spirit - by opening more and more shops. 
With over 1.6 crore retail shops in the country, about one for every 15 families, this sector of work outguns every other.
Manufacturing, considered the backbone of prosperity for any economy, is second to retail with over 1 crore units. 
But manufacturing employs over 3 crore people beating retail trade, which has about 2.7 crore.
Transport companies, warehousing, hotels and eateries, and healthcare-related enterprises are other major occupations, while educational enterprises have emerged as major employers with over 2 million such businesses employing nearly 1.1 million people.
These facts emerge from the 6th Economic Census conducted by the government in 2013, detailed results of which were released earlier this year. The economic census counts all kinds of enterprises across the country except cultivation of crops and their care and protection. 
In this census, some 5.8 crore enterprises were counted, employing over 13 crore persons. 
The previous one was done in 2005.
